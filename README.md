## Linear Algebra
This repository contains my notes and exercises for my Linear Algebra class using LaTeX.

## Purpose
Other than learning linear algebra, the other purpose of this repository is to get familiar with LaTeX's tags and syntax.

## Tools
I use texmaker to compile LaTeX and MiKTeX for packages installation.
