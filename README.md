## Linear Algebra
This repository contains my notes and exercises for my Linear Algebra class using LaTeX.

## Purpose
Other than learning linear algebra, the other purpose of this repository is to get familiar with LaTeX's tags and syntax.

## Textbook
Some exercises are based on the textbook: Lay, David C., et al. *Linear Algebra and Its Applications*. 5<sup>th</sup>ed., Pearson. 2016.

## Tools
I use texmaker to compile LaTeX and MiKTeX for packages installation.
