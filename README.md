## Linear Algebra
This repository contains my notes and exercises for my Linear Algebra class using LaTeX.

## Purpose
Other than learning linear algebra, the other purpose of this repository is to get familiar with LaTeX's tags and syntax.

## Textbook
Some exercises are based on the textbook: Strang, G. "Introduction to Linear Algebra." 4<sup>th</sup> ed., 2009.

## Tools
I use texmaker to compile LaTeX and MiKTeX for packages installation.
